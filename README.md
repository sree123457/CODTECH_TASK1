** Overview of Task1**


Blinking an LED with Arduino is one of the simplest and most common tasks for beginners in embedded systems.
It involves turning an LED on and off at regular intervals using an Arduino board, which is a microcontroller-based platform.

Components Required:
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
LED (Light Emitting Diode)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)


Overview:
The basic principle of blinking an LED using Arduino is to use digital pins to control the LED's power state. Arduino has multiple digital I/O pins that can either provide a HIGH (5V) signal or a LOW (0V or ground) signal. When the digital pin is set to HIGH, current flows through the LED, making it light up. When set to LOW, the current stops, and the LED turns off.


Circuit Setup:
Connect the Arduino to the computer via a USB cable for power and programming.
Place the LED on the breadboard.
The longer leg (anode, +) of the LED connects to the digital pin (e.g., pin 13).
The shorter leg (cathode, -) connects to the ground (GND) via a resistor to limit the current and prevent damage to the LED.
